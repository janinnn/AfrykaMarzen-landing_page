# AfrykaMarzen-landing_page
This is the landing page of the project called Afryka Marzen.
Afryka Marzen organizes adventure journeys in Africa.
The main page of the project was made in WP but in the future I want to change it.
This landing page purpose is to have like a hub for people redirecting from social media.
The purpose of the hub is of course to redirect to proper journeys but also to inform how does it look like
to be in an advernture like that. To distinquish this kind of trips from standard safari.

Also my experience in front-end is well... little...
